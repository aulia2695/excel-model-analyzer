LIVING INCOME DASHBOARD - DESIGN RATIONALE
================================================================================

DASHBOARD COMPONENTS:

1. KPI CARDS (Top Row)
   Purpose: Quick overview of key metrics
   Metrics:
   - Average Actual Income (current farmer income)
   - Living Income Benchmark (target)
   - Income Gap (difference and %)
   - % Farmers Below LI (population insight)
   
   Rationale: Executives need instant snapshot of program performance

2. WATERFALL CHART (Middle Left)
   Purpose: Visualize income gap components
   Shows: Benchmark → Revenue sources → Cost deductions → Actual income
   
   Formula: Actual Income = Cocoa Revenue + Other Revenue - Labor Cost - Input Cost
   
   Rationale: Identifies which factors contribute most to income gap

3. GAUGE CHART (Middle Right)
   Purpose: Show overall achievement vs. benchmark
   Displays: % of Living Income Benchmark achieved
   
   Calculation: (Actual Income / LI Benchmark) × 100
   
   Rationale: Visual indicator of progress toward goal

4. INCOME BREAKDOWN (Bottom Left)
   Purpose: Understand revenue diversification
   Shows: % contribution from cocoa vs. other sources
   
   Assumption: 72% cocoa revenue (from baseline study)
   
   Rationale: Helps identify opportunities for income diversification

5. COST STRUCTURE (Bottom Right)
   Purpose: Analyze production cost components
   Shows: Labor, fertilizer, pesticide, other input costs
   
   Rationale: Identifies cost reduction opportunities

6. PROGRESS TIMELINE (Bottom Full Width)
   Purpose: Track income improvement over time
   Shows: Quarterly average income trend + # farmers surveyed
   
   Rationale: Demonstrates program impact and data collection scale

================================================================================
DATA REQUIREMENTS:

Primary Data (Must Collect):
✓ Cocoa production volume (kg/farmer)
✓ Cocoa price received (CFA/kg)
✓ Other crop revenue
✓ Labor costs (hired + family labor valuation)
✓ Input costs (fertilizer, pesticides)

Secondary Data (Can Use Estimates Initially):
✓ Living Income Benchmark (3,612,000 CFA - KIT/Anker methodology)
✓ % Cocoa revenue of total income (72% from baseline study)

Calculated Metrics:
✓ Cocoa Revenue = Production (kg) × Price (CFA/kg)
✓ Total Revenue = Cocoa Revenue / 0.72
✓ Total Costs = Labor Costs + Input Costs
✓ Actual Income = Total Revenue - Total Costs
✓ Income Gap = LI Benchmark - Actual Income

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

1. Start with simple calculations using averages
2. As data collection scales to 3,000 farmers, add:
   - Drill-down by village/cooperative
   - Farmer-level income distribution histogram
   - Intervention impact tracking
   
3. Update frequency: Quarterly (aligned with harvest cycles)

4. Target audience: 
   - Executives: KPI cards, gauge, timeline
   - Program managers: Waterfall, regional comparison
   - Field teams: Cost structure, income breakdown
