DATA COLLECTION PLAN: LIVING INCOME PRODUCTION COST SURVEY
================================================================================
MEV Assistant & Operations Team Implementation Guide

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
Objective: Collect baseline data on production costs (labor + inputs) from 200 
          cocoa farmers across 4 cooperatives to enable Living Income monitoring

Timeline: 8 weeks
Budget: 3535.11 EUR

================================================================================
1. SAMPLING STRATEGY
================================================================================

Strategy: Stratified Random Sampling

Sample Size: 200 farmers
  • Cooperative A: 50 farmers
  • Cooperative B: 50 farmers
  • Cooperative C: 50 farmers
  • Cooperative D: 50 farmers

Selection Criteria:
  ✓ Random selection from farmer database (1000 farmers/cooperative)
  ✓ Minimum 30% female farmers for gender balance
  ✓ Land size distribution: 40% <2ha, 40% 2-4ha, 20% ≥4ha
  ✓ Include replacement list (10 farmers/coop) for non-respondents

================================================================================
2. DATA COLLECTION APPROACH
================================================================================

Selected Option: 2 Consultant Surveyors

Rationale:
  ✓ Instantly available (no recruitment delay)
  ✓ Already experienced in financial data collection
  ✓ No ongoing employment obligations
  ✓ Cost-effective for one-time baseline survey

Daily Capacity: 5 surveys per surveyor
Total Duration: 20 days per surveyor

Survey Scope: ~20 questions covering:
  • Labor costs (hired labor + family labor valuation)
  • Input costs (fertilizer quantities & prices)
  • Pesticide costs (types & amounts)
  • Other production expenses

================================================================================
3. IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE
================================================================================

Week 1: Planning & Preparation
  □ Finalize survey questionnaire with Sustainability Manager
  □ Coordinate with 4 cooperatives for farmer lists
  □ Select random sample + replacement farmers
  □ Arrange onboarding session logistics

Week 2: Onboarding & Pilot
  □ Conduct 1-day onboarding for consultant surveyors
  □ Review survey questions and data quality standards
  □ Pilot test with 10 farmers (not in main sample)
  □ Refine questionnaire based on pilot feedback

Week 3-7: Data Collection
  □ Deploy surveyors to cooperatives
  □ Daily progress tracking by MEV Assistant
  □ Immediate quality checks on completed surveys
  □ Address any field issues promptly

Week 8-9: Data Management
  □ Data entry into centralized database
  □ Run automated validation checks
  □ Flag outliers for verification
  □ Clean and finalize dataset

Week 10: Analysis & Reporting
  □ Calculate average production costs
  □ Estimate actual farmer incomes
  □ Generate Living Income Dashboard
  □ Prepare report for Manager

================================================================================
4. ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES
================================================================================

MEV Assistant:
  • Overall project coordination
  • Daily monitoring of survey progress
  • First-level data quality checks
  • Communication with consultants and cooperatives
  • Escalation of issues to Manager

Consultant Surveyors:
  • Conduct farmer interviews (5/day each)
  • Ensure data accuracy and completeness
  • Submit surveys daily via mobile app/forms
  • Report challenges immediately

Operations Team:
  • Facilitate access to farmers
  • Provide local context and translation if needed
  • Support logistics (meeting arrangements)

Sustainability Manager:
  • Provide cooperative contacts
  • Review and approve survey questionnaire
  • Address technical questions on cocoa practices

================================================================================
5. DATA QUALITY PROTOCOLS
================================================================================

During Collection:
  ✓ Mandatory fields enforcement in survey tool
  ✓ Range validation (costs must be > 0 and < reasonable max)
  ✓ Cross-checks (e.g., fertilizer cost = quantity × price)
  ✓ Daily review by MEV Assistant

Post-Collection:
  ✓ Completeness check: 100% of required fields filled
  ✓ Outlier detection: Flag values >3 standard deviations from mean
  ✓ Logical consistency: Production costs < cocoa revenue
  ✓ Sample representativeness: Verify gender/land size distribution

================================================================================
6. BUDGET ALLOCATION
================================================================================

Total Budget: 3535.11 EUR 
             (2,315,500 CFA)

7. KEY ASSUMPTIONS & FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Assumptions Made:
  • Survey duration: 1 hour per farmer (as advised)
  • Surveyors can complete 5 surveys/day (including travel)
  • Exchange rate: 655 CFA per EUR
  • Farmers will be available and willing to participate
  • Consultants can start immediately

Questions for Manager:
  1. Has the survey questionnaire been finalized and tested?
  2. Are the 4 target cooperatives confirmed and willing to participate?
  3. What is the contingency plan if consultants are unavailable?
  4. Should we collect any additional data while surveying (e.g., farm GPS)?
  5. What data storage/security protocols should be followed?

================================================================================
8. SUCCESS CRITERIA
================================================================================

  ✓ 200 surveys completed within budget and timeline
  ✓ <5% missing data across all required fields
  ✓ Data passes all quality validation checks
  ✓ Living Income Dashboard successfully generated
  ✓ Insights actionable for program improvement
