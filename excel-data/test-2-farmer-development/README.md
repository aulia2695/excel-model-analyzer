# Test 2: Farmer Development Plan Analysis (Ivory Coast)

## Project Overview
Analysis of the "Farm Development Plan" database containing farmer demographics and cocoa agronomic practices in Ivory Coast. This project aims to establish a baseline and develop a Living Income monitoring system.

## Background
- **Country**: Ivory Coast
- **Project**: Farm Development Plan (implemented last year)
- **Current Sample**: Initial dataset from local Operations Team
- **Scale**: Planning to survey 3,000 more farmers in next 6 months

## Main Objectives

EXERCISE 1: Farmer Development Plan Analysis
I need to create a 2-pager report with these specific analyses:
Analysis 1.1: Baseline Distribution
For the 14 Adoption Variables:

Calculate distribution of farmers across Good/Medium/Bad categories
Based on "Result" (current adoption)
Based on "Competence" (skillset)
Show: What % of farmers are in each category (G/M/B) for each variable?

Analysis 1.2: Progress Tracking
Compare Visit 1 vs Visit 2:

% farmers making progress (improved from visit 1 to 2)
% farmers staying at same level (no change)
% farmers deteriorating (got worse from visit 1 to 2)

Analysis 1.3: Production (Yield) Baseline
Calculate Average Production ("Farm: Production - last baseline KG") segmented by:
By Gender:

Male farmers: average yield
Female farmers: average yield

By Land Size:

<2ha: average yield
2-4ha: average yield
≥4ha: average yield

Analysis 1.4: Recommendations
Provide 2-3 most important recommendations for:

Data completeness/quality during collection (for the upcoming 3,000 farmer survey)
Data cleaning/quality checks for M&E Assistant and Operations Team


EXERCISE 2: Living Income Dashboard Design
Create a sketch/mockup of a Living Income Dashboard showing:
Components to Include:
Based on the DISCO framework, I need to visualize:

Living Income Benchmark (from credible sources like Anker & Anker, LICOP, KIT)
Actual Farmer Income - calculated from:

Cocoa revenue = Volume sourced × Price (1000 CFA/kg + 40 CFA/kg premium)
Total revenue = Cocoa revenue ÷ 0.72 (since cocoa is 72% of total income)
Actual income = Total revenue - Production costs


Living Income Gap = Benchmark - Actual Income
Production Costs breakdown (labor + inputs)

Visualization Types:

Use dummy data
Sketch in PowerPoint/Excel (no sophisticated tools needed)
Show chart types (bar charts, line graphs, gauges, etc.)


EXERCISE 3: Data Collection Plan for Production Costs
Design the data collection system for measuring production costs from 200 farmers across 4 cooperatives.
What I Need to Deliver:
A) Data Collection Plan (max ½ page)
Include:

Who will collect data (choose between options below)
Sample design: How to select 200 farmers from 4 cooperatives (1,000 farmers each)
Timeline: Gantt chart showing survey schedule
Organization: Org chart or responsibilities
Instructions for MEV Assistant and Operations Team

B) Budget Breakdown
Compare two options and choose one:
Option 1: Dedicated Field Trainers (hired by cooperative)

Cost: 200,000 CFA/month each
Need training: 100,000 CFA per trainer
Can do 5 surveys/day
Multi-tasking (also do other work)

Option 2: Consultant Surveyors

Cost: 30,000 CFA/day each
Onboarding: 1,000 EUR for all consultants
Can do 5 surveys/day
Already experienced, instantly available

Constraints:

20 questions per survey
1 hour per survey
Maximum 5 surveys/day per surveyor
Total budget: ~5,000 EUR
Sample: 200 farmers from 4 cooperatives

C) Document My Decision-Making
Explain:

My assumptions
Why I chose this approach
Alternative scenarios considered
Follow-up questions I have

## Notes
Focus on decision-making process and assumptions rather than finding "perfect" answers. Document all choices and rationale.
