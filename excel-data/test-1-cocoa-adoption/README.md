# Test 1: Cocoa Adoption Analysis (Ecuador)

## Project Overview
Analysis of cocoa farming practices and adoption patterns across different farms in Ecuador to improve sustainable cocoa production.

## Objective
Clean, analyze, and present data to gain insights into cocoa adoption patterns. Results will inform decision-making and develop strategies to promote cocoa adoption among farmers.

## Dataset Information
- **Country**: Ecuador
- **Focus**: Agricultural techniques and farming practices
- **Key Variables**: 
  - Farm characteristics (size, location)
  - Farmer demographics (age, gender, experience)
  - Agricultural practices (fertilizer use, pest management, pruning, etc.)
  - Regional and weather factors

## Analysis Tasks

### 1. Data Cleaning
- [x] Check for missing values
- [x] Remove duplicates and irrelevant columns
- [x] Handle outliers based on domain knowledge

### 2. Data Analysis
- [ ] Explore distribution of cocoa adoption across criteria
- [ ] Investigate relationship between adoption and farm size
- [ ] Analyze adoption rates by region
- [ ] Examine weather factors' influence on adoption

### 3. Data Presentation
- [ ] Create visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots)
- [ ] Prepare comprehensive report
- [ ] Develop actionable recommendations

## Key Questions to Answer
1. What is the current state of cocoa adoption across farms?
2. How does farm size influence adoption rates?
3. Which regions show highest/lowest adoption?
4. What weather patterns correlate with better adoption?
5. What are the main barriers to adoption?
